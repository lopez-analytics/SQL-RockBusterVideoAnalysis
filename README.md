# SQL-RockBusterVideoAnalysis
Rockbuster Stealth LLC Data Analysis Project
Introduction:
In this project, I am tasked with developing a data strategy for Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a
traditional movie rental company striving to compete with streaming services. My objective
is to analyze their data using SQL to support the launch of their new online video rental
service. This analysis will provide Rockbuster Stealth management with data-driven
insights for their 2020 strategy.
Key Questions:
- Which movies drive the most revenue?
- What is the average rental duration for videos?
- What are the demographics of Rockbuster customers?
- Where are the high-value customers located?
- How do sales compare across different regions?
Context:
The project involves using SQL for detailed data analysis to answer questions from various
departments, aiding the decision-making process for the transition to an online service. The
skills demonstrated here are applicable across industries, highlighting problem-solving
capabilities in data analytics.
Data Set:
The dataset contains information on Rockbuster’s film inventory, customers, and
transactions, stored in a PostgreSQL database. It is structured to simulate real-world
business scenarios and relationships between different data tables.
Project Deliverables:
The project will conclude with a comprehensive analysis that includes:
- SQL queries addressing management’s questions.
-  [Tableau visualizations](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alejandro.lopex/viz/3_10Story/Story1?publish=yes).
- A narrative that translates complex data into actionable business insights.
Final Analysis:
This repository demonstrates not only technical proficiency in SQL but also the ability to
transform data into strategic business outcomes.
